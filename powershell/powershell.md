## Control flow

- Default switch

  ```ps1
  $var = 42
  
  switch ($var)
  {
    41 { "Forty one" }
    42 { "Forty two" }
    43 { "Forty three" }

    "PowerShell" { "MixedCase" }
  }
  ```

  {
    "plural*" { "*" }
    "?luralsight" { "?" }
    "Pluralsi???" { "???" }
  }
  ```

- Regex switch

  {
    "[a-d]" {"The color is red."}

    default {"The color could not be determined."}
  }
  ```

## Chain Commands

Commands can be chained by separate them with `;`

```ps1
clear; npm install; npm run build
```

## Pipelining Commands

Commands can be pipelined by separate them with `|`, this will pass the results to the next command

```ps1
Set-Location C:\Windows\System32\

# Get the items and filter the results
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object { $_.Length -lt 1kb }

# Get the items, filter the results and display them in a grid
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object { $_.Length -lt 1kb } | Out-GridView
```

## Script blocks

```ps1
# Run a script block
& { Clear-host; Write-Host "PowerShell is cool !" }

# Store and run a script block
$cool = { Clear-host; Write-Host "PowerShell is cool !" }

# Run a variable with a stored script
& $cool
```

## Functions

- Basic function

  ```ps1
  function Write-HelloWorld()
  {
    Clear-Host
    Write-Host "Hello World"
  }

  Write-HelloWorld
  ```

- Function with parameters

  ```ps1

  function Get-FullName($firstName, $lastName)
  {
    Write-Host ($firstName + " " + $lastName)
  }

  Get-FullName "David" "Smith"
  Get-FullName -lastName "Smith" -firstName "David"
  ```

### Comments in functions

```ps1
<#
  .SYNOPSIS
  Shows a hello message.

  .PARAMETER subject
  The subject.

  .EXAMPLE
  Show-Hello "David"

  .EXAMPLE
  Show-Hello subject "David"
#>
function Show-Hello($subject)
{
  Write-Host "Hello $subject!"
}
```

### Pipeline functions

The pipeline functions are useful for pass the results of a cmdlet to another function.

```ps1

function Show-Result()
{
  Begin
  {
    # Executes once before first item in pipeline is processed
  }
  Process
  {
    # Executes once for each pipeline object
    Write-Host "Item: $_"
  }
  End
  {
    # Executes once after last pipeline object is processed
  }
}

Get-ChildItem | Show-Result
```

## Formats & Outputs

TBC

## Modules

```ps1
# Lists the loaded modules
Get-Module

# Lists the available modules to import
Get-Module â€“ListAvailable

# Import-Module
Import-Module WebAdministration

# Get a module and show the members (properties and methods)
Get-Module WebAdministration | Get-Member
```

  - Checking if the current user is part of the administrators group

    ```ps1
    If (-NOT ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.  Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.  Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]"Administrator"))
    {
      Write-Warning "You do not have Administrator rights to run this script!"

      Write-Host "Please re-run this script as an Administrator!" -ForegroundColor Red

      # Start powershell as admin
