# TOGAF 9.2

Certification path:

1. TOGAF 9 Foundation
2. TOGAF 9 Certified

## Foundation

Parts:

1. Introduction
2. Architecture Development Method (ADM)
3. Guidelines and Techniques
4. Architecture Content Framework
5. Enterprise Continuum
6. Architecture Capability Framework

Additional material can be found in the _Core Standard_ + _TOGAF Library_.

Core Concepts:

1. The definition of enterprise
2. The architecture domains: Business, Data, Application and Technology (BDAT)
   - Business Domain
   - Data Domain
3. The architecture development method, or ADM
4. Deliverables, artifacts and building blocks
5. The enterprise continuum
6. The architecture repository
7. And, defining architecture capability

## BDAT

These are the four architectural domains:

- Business Domain
- Data Domain
- Application Domain
- Technology Domain

## ADM

These are the phases in the  _Architecture Development Framework_:

- [Preliminary Phase](./adm/0-preliminary-phase.md)
- [A: Architecture Vision](./adm/a-architecture-vision.md)
- [B: Business Architecture](./adm/b-business-architecture.md)
- [C: Information System Architectures](./adm/c-information-system-architectures.md)
- [D: Technology Architecture](./adm/d-technology-architecture.md)
- [E: Opportunities and Solutions](./adm/e-opportunities-and-solutions.md)
- [F: Migration Planning](./adm/f-migration-planning.md)
- [G: Implementation Governance](./adm/g-implementation-governance.md)
- [H: Architecture Change Management](./adm/h-architecture-change-management.md)
- [Requirements Management](./adm/requirements-management.md)

These are structure in the following way:

- Preliminary Phase
- `B`, `C` and `D`: [BDAT](#bdat)
- `E` and `F`: Planning
- `G`: Implementation
- `H`: Change Management

Apart from all these there is an additional one called: _Requirements Management Phase_ which is ongoing alongside with the others.

## ACF

These are the items in the _Architecture Content Framework_:

- Artifacts
- Deliverables
- Building Blocks

## Architecture Repository Structure

- Architecture Metamodel
- Architecture Capability
- Architecture Landscape
- Standard Information Base (SIB)
- Reference Library
- Governance Log
- Architecture Requirements Repository (new in 9.2)
- Solutions Landscape (new in 9.2)

### Architecture Capability

People and processes that establish the architecture. This sits between governance and repository
