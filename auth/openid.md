# OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity authentication protocol that is an extension of open authorization (OAuth) 2.0 to standardize the process for authenticating and authorizing users when they sign in to access digital services. OIDC provides authentication, which means verifying that users are who they say they are. OAuth 2.0 authorizes which systems those users are allowed to access. OAuth 2.0 is typically used to enable two unrelated applications to share information without compromising user data. For example, many people use their email or social media accounts to sign in to a third-party site rather than creating a new username and password. OIDC is also used to provide single sign-on.
