## Ticket Types

- Epic: A big user story that needs to be broken down. Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative. In agile development, epics usually represent a significant deliverable, such as a new feature or experience in the software your team develops.

- Bug: A bug is a problem which impairs or prevents the functions of a product.

- Story: A user story is the smallest unit of work that needs to be done.

- Task: A task represents work that needs to be done.

- Subtask: A subtask is a piece of work that is required to complete a task.
