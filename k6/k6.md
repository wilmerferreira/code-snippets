# K6

## Installation

- Using [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)

  ```ps1
  winget install k6

  # To check if already install
  winget list --id k6.k6
  ```

- Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

  ```ps1
  choco install k6
  ```

## Getting Started

Basic Script

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

Run Tests

```shell
k6 run script.js
```

## Options

By default (when no options are set) will use the following settings: 1 iterations for each of 1 VUs (maxDuration: 10m0s, gracefulStop: 30s)

These options can be set in the following ways:

- Using the `options` object

  ```js
  import http from 'k6/http';
  import { sleep } from 'k6';

  export const options = {
    vus: 10,
    duration: '30s',
  };

  export default function () {
    http.get('http://test.k6.io');
    sleep(1);
  }
  ```

- Using the k6 command

  ```sh
  k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s script.js
  ```

  > The command configuration will override any settings defined in the `options` object

## Test Types

- Smoke: Smoke test is a regular load test, configured for minimal load. You want to run a smoke test as a sanity check every time you write a new script or modify an existing script.

  - Verify that your test script doesn't have errors.
  - Verify that your system doesn't throw any errors when under minimal load.

- Load: Load Testing is primarily concerned with assessing the current performance of your system in terms of concurrent users or requests per second. When you want to understand if your system is meeting the performance goals, this is the type of test you'll run.

  > Load Testing is a type of Performance Testing used to determine a system's behavior under both normal and peak conditions. Load Testing is used to ensure that the application performs satisfactorily when many users access it at the same time.

  - Assess the current performance of your system under typical and peak load.
  - Make sure you continue to meet the performance standards as you make changes to your system (code and infrastructure).

- Stress: Assess the availability and stability of the system under heavy load

  > Stress Testing is a type of load testing used to determine the limits of the system. The purpose of this test is to verify the stability and reliability of the system under extreme conditions.

  - How your system will behave under extreme conditions.
  - What the maximum capacity of your system is in terms of users or throughput.
  - The breaking point of your system and its failure mode.
  - If your system will recover without manual intervention after the stress test is over.

- Soak: Checks the reliability over a longer period of time

  - Verify that your system doesn't suffer from bugs or memory leaks, which result in a crash or restart after several hours of operation.
  - Verify that expected application restarts don't lose requests.
  - Find bugs related to race-conditions that appear sporadically.
  - Make sure your database doesn't exhaust the allotted storage space and stops.
  - Make sure your logs don't exhaust the allotted disk storage.
  - Make sure the external services you depend on don't stop working after a certain amount of requests are executed.
